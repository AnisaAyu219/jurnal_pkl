### ðŸ§© The Problem
During the implementation of the Praktik Kerja Lapangan (PKL) or student internship program, supervising teachers often face difficulties in monitoring students who are placed outside of school. Supervision is usually carried out through direct visits to the internship locations, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and not always practical to do regularly.

On the other hand, students frequently forget to record their daily activities during the internship. These daily logs are essential, as they are required to compile the final PKL report, which is a key component of their evaluation.

**As a result:**
- Teachers struggle to track student attendance and progress in real-time.
- Students face challenges when preparing their final reports due to missing or incomplete activity logs.
- The reporting process becomes inaccurate and may not truly reflect the students' actual internship activities.

### âœ… The Solution
To address the issues encountered during the internship (PKL) process, a web-based PKL Journal application was developed to streamline the recording and monitoring of student activities throughout the program.

**Through this application:**
- Supervising teachers can monitor student attendance and daily activities online, without the need for frequent on-site visits. All student data is accessible in real-time, making it easier for teachers to provide guidance and conduct evaluations.
- Students can regularly log their daily internship activities directly into the system. This eliminates the need for manual records or relying on memory when the internship ends. The recorded data can also be automatically exported into a structured PKL report, saving time and ensuring accuracy in report preparation.
- This application improves the PKL process by making it more efficient, transparent, and well-documented for both students and teachers.

### âœ¨ Features of the Web-Based Internship Journal Application
- **Student and Teacher Login**
Both students and supervising teachers log into the system using their respective accounts. Each user has access based on their role.
- **Student Attendance Input**
Students record their daily attendance through the application. This eliminates the need for manual attendance sheets or teacher visits.
- **Teacher Views Student Attendance Data**
Supervising teachers can monitor student attendance in real-time, enabling more efficient and remote supervision.
- **Student Activity Journal Input**
Students fill in their daily internship activities through a structured journal form. These entries become the main source for their final internship report.
- **Teacher Views Student Journal**
Teachers can review student journals at any time, allowing them to ensure students are actively participating and consistently documenting their experience.
- **Student Prints Internship Report**
Once completed, students can export their journal entries into a printable internship report. This simplifies the report-writing process and saves time.
- **Student Inputs Feedback (Impressions & Messages)**
At the end of the internship, students are asked to provide impressions and messages about their internship experience. To give students space for reflection and evaluation. To provide valuable input for supervising teachers in assessing whether the internship location is suitable for future students.
